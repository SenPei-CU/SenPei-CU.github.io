Next-generation mathematical models of infectious diseases require better representation of human behavior in order to improve simulation, inference and forecasting accuracy. In an NSF-funded project, we will leverage behavior theories and detailed data to develop behavior-driven epidemic models, study the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, and generate improved forecasting systems. These studies will promote the integration of mathematical, epidemiological, and behavioral sciences to deepen understanding about behavior-disease interaction.
