This is a graduate course introducing concepts in network science and applications in public health.


Course Description
======

As a methodological tool and a theoretical paradigm, network analysis has been increasingly used in public health. This course introduces fundamental concepts in network science and complex systems, applications in public health, and quantitative skills in analyzing network data. The course centers around two themes â€“ the structure and function of networked systems. We will delve into a variety of public health applications including climate and health, transmission of infectious diseases, diffusion of health behaviors, social networks, and exposome and health. Over the course, students will have hands-on excises and group projects to perform analysis on network data. Students are expected to gain an overview of current research topics on network analysis in public health and develop practical quantitative skills to analyze network data.
