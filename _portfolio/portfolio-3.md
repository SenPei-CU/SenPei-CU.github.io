Antimicrobial resistant (AMR) pathogens remain a major cause of healthcare associated infections (HAIs) worldwide. The increasing prevalence of emerging AMR agents continues to impose a heavy burden on global healthcare systems. In light of this situation, control of AMR infections becomes a pressing issue. To address this problem, we developed mathematical models at various scales to simulate transmission of AMR pathogens in healthcare facilities, and used those models to design better targeted intervention against HAIs. Our research particularly focuses on the interactions between community and nosocomial transmission, as well as asymptomatic carriage of AMR pathogens.

The study on identifying asymptomatic spreaders of MRSA is highlighted by [Nature's Research Highlight](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02466-x).
