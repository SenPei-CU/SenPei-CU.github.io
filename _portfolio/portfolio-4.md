Similar with numerical weather prediction, operational forecast of infectious disease outbreaks can be realized using dynamical models in conjunction with data assimilation techniques. We developed computational methods to advance real-time forecasts of infectious disease spread, with a particular focus on the spatial transmission of influenza, dengue, and COVID-19. We also addressed the problem of optimizing surveillance networks for respiratory diseases.
